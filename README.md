# T-Pot Honeypot Deployment on AWS

## Objective
The T-Pot honeypot deployment aimed to establish a decoy system within an AWS environment to detect and analyze cyber attacks. By simulating vulnerable services and capturing malicious activities, the project helped in understanding attacker behavior and providing insights for strengthening network security.

### Skills Learned
- Practical application of honeypot deployment and configuration.
- Advanced understanding of attack detection and monitoring techniques.
- Experience with cloud security practices and AWS environments.
- Proficiency in using T-Pot for real-world attack simulations and analysis.
- Enhanced knowledge of cybersecurity defense strategies through hands-on experience with attack patterns.

### Tools Used
- AWS for cloud hosting and infrastructure management.
- T-Pot (Debian 12) for honeypot deployment and attack detection.
- Kibana and Elasticsearch for log analysis and visualization.
- Suricata and other tools included in T-Pot for attack pattern recognition and response.
