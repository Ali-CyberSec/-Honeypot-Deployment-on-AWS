# T-Pot Honeypot Deployment on AWS

## Objective
The T-Pot honeypot deployment aimed to establish a decoy system within an AWS environment to detect and analyze cyber attacks. By simulating vulnerable services and capturing malicious activities, the project helped in understanding attacker behavior and providing insights for strengthening network security.

## Skills Learned
- Practical application of honeypot deployment and configuration.
- Advanced understanding of attack detection and monitoring techniques.
- Experience with cloud security practices and AWS environments.
- Proficiency in using T-Pot for real-world attack simulations and analysis.
- Enhanced knowledge of cybersecurity defense strategies through hands-on experience with attack patterns.

## Tools Used
- **AWS**: Cloud hosting and infrastructure management.
- **T-Pot (Debian 12)**: Honeypot deployment and attack detection.
- **Cowrie**: Capturing common username/password attempts.
- **Suricata**: Monitoring attack commands and privilege escalation attempts.
- **Elasticsearch**: Log storage and analysis.

### 5. Automated Attacks
**Explanation:** Attackers are leveraging automation to conduct large-scale attacks rather than manually interacting with systems. This is evident in an Excel log showcasing back-to-back attack attempts occurring within a single minute. The high frequency and consistency of these attacks highlight the use of scripts and botnets to exploit vulnerabilities efficiently.
